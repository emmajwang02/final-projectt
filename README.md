a. To-Do List Application 

b. The purpose of this project is to program a working to-do list application, for the user to add reminders, check their calender, and update a to-do list with certain tasks. 

c. By the end of the semester, my goal is to have 3 working pages. For the reminders tab, I will try to set due dates and notifications to remind the user of time-sensitive tasks. I will try to make a calendar that allows user to add events based on daily, weekly, and monthly scheduling. For the to-do list tab, I will try to add an option so the user can add multiple lists and add tasks to certain lists specifically. Ultimately, I want to combine my favourite elements of the reminders, calendar, and notes app on my phone to a web application. 

d. This web app will be programmed with HTML and Streamlit in Python.
